## Machine Overview

The Bridgeport mill is a vertical knee mill with:
- A **ram** that allows the head to slide in and out
- A **turret** that rotates the head
- A **knee** that adjusts vertically
- A **table** that moves in X (left/right) and Y (in/out)
- A **quill** for Z-axis control
- A **spindle** that holds cutting tools via R8 collets

---

## Startup & Safety

1. **Wear safety glasses** at all times.
2. Verify machine is **clean** and **free of obstructions**.
3. Ensure all handles and locks are **secure** before powering on.
4. **Check lubrication** levels (one-shot oiler if equipped).
5. **Engage E-stop** before plugging in or switching on the main power.

---

## Spindle & Collet System

Bridgeports use **R8 collets** to hold tooling (end mills, drill chucks, etc.).

### Loading and Removing Collets

#### Loading a Collet:
1. Raise the knee to bring the spindle within reach.
2. Insert the R8 collet into the **spindle taper**.
3. Thread the **drawbar** (top of spindle) into the collet.
4. Use one wrench to **hold the spindle** (or engage spindle brake) and another to **tighten the drawbar**.
5. Insert the tool into the collet and tighten again if necessary.

#### Removing a Collet:
1. Hold the spindle with the brake or wrench.
2. Loosen the drawbar several turns.
3. Tap the top of the drawbar lightly with a **soft mallet** to release the collet.
4. Remove collet and tool.

## Table and Axis Movement

- **X-axis:** Left/right via table handwheel.
- **Y-axis:** In/out via saddle handwheel.
- **Z-axis (knee):** Up/down via vertical crank.

### Locking Table Axes

Each axis has a **gib lock**:
- Turn clockwise to lock the axis.
- Typically lock unused axes during cutting to increase rigidity.

| Axis | Lock Location |
|------|----------------|
| X    | Front of saddle, under the table |
| Y    | Right side of saddle |
| Z (Knee) | Right side of the column |

## Quill Operation

The quill controls Z-axis motion for drilling and precision depth milling.

### Manual Feed

- Use the **quill feed lever** (downward) for rapid manual drilling.
- Use the **fine feed wheel** for precision vertical adjustments.

### Quill Lock

- Located on the right side of the head.
- Turn to lock the quill in position for milling operations.

### Quill Autofeed

1. Set feed rate lever (usually 0.0015", 0.003", 0.006" per rev).
2. Engage the **feed direction** lever (up = up, down = down).
3. Start spindle.
4. Engage feed with the **clutch knob** (push in).
5. Disengage manually or let it **trip off** at depth stop.

---

## Power Feed on Table

Optional on some machines:
1. Ensure feed gearbox is engaged (check oil).
2. Use the control box to:
   - Set **direction**.
   - Set **speed**.
   - **Engage/disengage** feed.
3. Watch out for **end-of-travel stops** to avoid damage.

---

## Speed Control

### Belt Change Head

1. **Power off** the machine.
2. Open the top cover.
3. Loosen the **motor mount lever**.
4. Manually shift the drive belt between pulleys.
5. Retighten and close cover.

### Variable Speed Head (2J Head)

1. Power on the machine.
2. Adjust the **speed crank** (front or side) while spindle is **running**.
3. Match RPM to tool size and material.

---

## Tramming the Head

Used to align the head perpendicular to the table:

1. Mount a dial indicator on the spindle.
2. Sweep across a test indicator circle on the table.
3. Adjust using:
   - **Turret bolts** for side tilt.
   - **Ram bolts** for front/back tilt.
4. Repeat sweep and adjustment until dial reads nearly zero across the circle.

---

## Maintenance Tips

- Oil ways daily using **one-shot oiler** or manual oil points.
- Keep ways and table **clean and free of chips**.
- Avoid **running the spindle dry** (ensure proper lubrication).
- Periodically check for backlash and gib adjustments.
- Store collets and tools properly.

## Final Notes

Always consult your shop supervisor or instructor when learning a new setup or operation. Respect the machineâ€”it's powerful, precise, and potentially dangerous if misused.
