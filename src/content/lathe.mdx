## Lathe Overview

The Colchester manual lathe typically includes:

- Quick-change **gearbox** for feed/thread selection
- **Leadscrew** for threading
- **Feed rod** for turning/facing
- **3-jaw chuck** for general workholding
- **Collet chuck** for precision holding
- **Tailstock** for drilling/centering
- **Compound rest** and **cross slide**
- **Taper attachment** for angled turning
- Wheel-type **spindle speed selector**

---

## Startup & Safety

1. Wear **safety glasses** and avoid loose clothing.
2. Ensure the **chuck key** is removed before starting.
3. Check that all levers are **disengaged**.
4. Verify the machine is **clean and oiled**.
5. Confirm tool is **securely clamped**.
6. Start lathe from the **lowest RPM** setting.

## Workholding

### Installing and Using a 3-Jaw Chuck

- Mounts directly to the spindle nose.
- Self-centering, best for round or hex stock.
- Use for most turning and facing operations.
- Tighten using **only one key hole** to avoid warping.
- Inspect jaws for wear and clean thoroughly before mounting.

### Installing and Using a Collet Chuck

1. Insert the **collet adapter** into the spindle (some models use a drawbar or lever-style collet closer).
2. Insert the appropriate collet size.
3. Insert the workpiece and **tighten the drawbar** or engage the closer.
4. Ensure the collet is seated flush and secure.
- **Collets are ideal for small, accurate work**, minimizing runout.

---

## Spindle Speed Selection

Colchester lathes often use a **dial or wheel-type selector**:

1. Always **stop the spindle** before changing speeds.
2. Use the **spindle speed chart** on the headstock to:
   - Match material type and tool diameter to recommended RPM.
   - Rotate the **selector wheel** to match gear combinations (A-B-C / 1-2-3).
3. Use lower speeds for:
   - Larger diameters
   - Harder materials
   - Threading and tapping
4. Use higher speeds for:
   - Small diameters
   - Softer materials
   - Finishing passes

## Feeds and Cutting Modes

### Selecting Feeds

1. Use the **quick-change gearbox chart** to select:
   - Feed per revolution (e.g., 0.005", 0.010"/rev)
   - Thread pitch (e.g., 20 TPI or 1.5mm)
2. Adjust **gear levers** to the charted position.
3. Engage either the **feed rod** (for general cutting) or **leadscrew** (for threading).

### Engaging Feed Levers

- **Cross Feed**: Moves tool in/out (toward center).
- **Longitudinal Feed**: Moves tool left/right.
- Use the apron lever to engage automatic feed.
- Always monitor movement direction before cutting.

---

## Facing, Turning, and Drilling

- **Facing**: Position tool perpendicular to spindle axis. Feed cross slide toward center.
- **Turning**: Align tool parallel to spindle axis. Feed longitudinally to reduce diameter.
- **Drilling**: Use the tailstock with a center drill, followed by drill bits.

---

## Using the Taper Attachment

1. Disconnect the **cross slide** screw (slotted nut under the slide).
2. Set desired taper angle on the **scale** of the taper attachment.
3. Lock attachment guide bar.
4. Slide the cross slide along the taper path, which is now guided by the attachment.
5. For external tapers, feed longitudinally.
6. Use light cuts and check frequently with micrometers or taper gauge.

## Thread Cutting

### Thread Pitch Selection

- Consult the **gearbox chart** to find the lever combination for desired TPI (inches) or mm pitch (metric).
- Ensure **half-nut lever** is disengaged before selecting thread pitch.

### Gearbox & Lead Screw Setup

1. Engage the **leadscrew** for threading.
2. Use **appropriate tool** with correct thread profile (e.g., 60° for UNC/UNF).
3. Set compound rest at **29°** for inch threads (or 27.5° for metric approximation).
4. Align compound to feed into the thread angle.

### Cutting Threads with a Thread Dial

1. Set spindle speed to **low RPM** (typically 100–200 RPM).
2. Use the **thread dial indicator**:
   - For even-numbered threads (e.g. 16, 20 TPI), engage half-nut on **any line**.
   - For odd-numbered threads, engage on **specific lines** as indicated in manual.
3. Make multiple passes:
   - First pass = scratch pass (verify pitch with gauge).
   - Use **compound feed** to advance tool slightly per pass (e.g., 0.005").
4. Stop the spindle and back out at end of thread.
5. Repeat until thread is to proper depth.
6. Optional: use a **thread relief groove** at end of thread.

## Shutdown & Cleanup

1. Return spindle to lowest RPM.
2. Turn off the lathe.
3. Clean chips from bed, slides, and chuck.
4. Oil ways and lead screw if required.
5. Store tools, chucks, and collets properly.

## Notes

- **Thread pitch charts** and **material speed/feed reference charts** should be posted near the machine.
- Always verify clearances before starting the spindle.
- Cutting fluids may be used to improve finish and tool life.
