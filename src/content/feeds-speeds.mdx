# Machine Shop Fundamentals: Cutting Speeds and Feeds

Welcome to the fundamentals of metal cutting in a machine shop. This guide covers essential concepts for safe and efficient machining operations.

## Understanding Cutting Speed

Cutting speed (V) is the speed at which the cutting tool moves relative to the workpiece. It's typically measured in:
- Surface feet per minute (SFM) in imperial units
- Meters per minute (m/min) in metric units

### Basic Formula
```
Cutting Speed (SFM) = (π × D × RPM) ÷ 12
```
Where:
- D = Diameter of the workpiece or tool (inches)
- RPM = Revolutions per minute
- π = 3.14159

## Material-Specific Cutting Speeds

| Material | Cutting Speed (SFM) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Aluminum | 250-1000 |
| Brass | 200-400 |
| Bronze | 150-300 |
| Cast Iron | 50-150 |
| Mild Steel | 100-200 |
| Stainless Steel | 50-150 |
| Tool Steel | 50-100 |

## Calculating RPM

### For Lathe Operations
```
RPM = (Cutting Speed × 12) ÷ (π × D)
```

### For Milling Operations
```
RPM = (Cutting Speed × 12) ÷ (π × D)
```
Where D is the cutter diameter

## Feed Rates

Feed rate is the speed at which the tool advances into the workpiece.

### Common Feed Rates
- Roughing: 0.010-0.020 inches per revolution
- Finishing: 0.002-0.010 inches per revolution

## Depth of Cut

### General Guidelines
- Roughing: 0.100-0.250 inches
- Finishing: 0.010-0.030 inches

## Tool Selection

### Common Tool Materials
1. **High-Speed Steel (HSS)**
   - Good for general purpose machining
   - Can be sharpened multiple times
   - Lower cost

2. **Carbide**
   - Higher cutting speeds
   - Better wear resistance
   - More brittle than HSS

3. **Cobalt**
   - Good for high-temperature applications
   - Better wear resistance than HSS
   - More expensive

## Coolant and Lubrication

### Types of Coolants
1. **Soluble Oils**
   - General purpose
   - Good cooling properties
   - Easy to maintain

2. **Synthetic Coolants**
   - Better cooling
   - Longer life
   - More expensive

3. **Cutting Oils**
   - Best for threading
   - Good lubrication
   - Messy to clean

## Safety Considerations

### Essential Safety Rules
1. Always wear appropriate PPE:
   - Safety glasses
   - Hearing protection
   - Proper footwear
   - No loose clothing

2. Machine Safety:
   - Check workholding before starting
   - Verify tool setup
   - Use proper guards
   - Never leave machine running unattended

## Common Problems and Solutions

### Chatter
- Reduce cutting speed
- Increase feed rate
- Check tool rigidity
- Verify workholding

### Poor Surface Finish
- Check tool sharpness
- Adjust feed rate
- Verify coolant flow
- Check tool geometry

### Tool Breakage
- Reduce cutting speed
- Check tool setup
- Verify workholding
- Use proper tool for material

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Turning Mild Steel
```
Material: Mild Steel
Diameter: 2 inches
Cutting Speed: 100 SFM

RPM = (100 × 12) ÷ (π × 2)
RPM = 191
```

### Example 2: Milling Aluminum
```
Material: Aluminum
Cutter Diameter: 0.5 inches
Cutting Speed: 600 SFM

RPM = (600 × 12) ÷ (π × 0.5)
RPM = 4,583
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**
   - Begin with lower speeds
   - Increase gradually
   - Monitor tool wear

2. **Tool Maintenance**
   - Keep tools sharp
   - Clean after use
   - Store properly

3. **Workpiece Preparation**
   - Clean surfaces
   - Check dimensions
   - Verify material

4. **Machine Maintenance**
   - Regular cleaning
   - Check alignment
   - Lubricate as needed
