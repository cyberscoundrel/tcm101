## Tool Holding Systems

### R8 Collets (Manual Mills)
- Standard for Bridgeport-style milling machines
- Precision-ground collets grip end mill shanks directly
- Must be matched to exact tool shank diameter

### End Mill Holders
- Use a set screw to hold the flat on a Weldon shank
- More secure for heavy cuts, less concentric than collets

### Drill Chucks
- Hold twist drills and reamers
- Not ideal for side-load cutting like milling

### Shell Mill Arbors
- For larger face mills with bolt-on cutters
- Require drawbar and proper key alignment

## Tool Materials and Coatings

| Material/Coating   | Benefits                              | Notes                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **HSS**            | Tough, easy to resharpen              | Best for small shops         |
| **Cobalt HSS (M42)** | Higher heat resistance              | Harder materials             |
| **Carbide**        | Very hard, long-lasting               | CNC or rigid setups          |
| **TiN Coating**    | General purpose, gold color           | Reduces wear/friction        |
| **TiAlN, AlTiN**   | High-temp coatings, dark gray/blue    | For steel/stainless at high speed |
| **ZrN, DLC**       | Low-friction coatings for aluminum    | Prevents built-up edge       |

## Feeds, Speeds, and Maintenance

### Feeds & Speeds
- Follow manufacturer charts or use calculators
- General starting point for HSS in mild steel:
  - Surface Speed: ~100 SFM
  - Feed: 0.002–0.006 in/tooth
- Carbide: Much faster (300–600 SFM)

### Chip Load Guidelines (per tooth)
| Cutter Size | HSS Feed/tooth | Carbide Feed/tooth |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| ⅛" – ¼"     | 0.001–0.003"   | 0.002–0.005"       |
| ½" – ¾"     | 0.004–0.006"   | 0.005–0.010"       |

### Maintenance
- **Inspect collets** for cracks or dirt
- **Lubricate drawbar threads**
- **Keep cutters clean and sharp**
- Use **cutting fluid** when appropriate (oil, mist, coolant)
