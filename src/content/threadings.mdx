# Cutting Interior and Exterior Threads on a Lathe (Using the Compound Rest)

This guide explains how to cut both **external** and **internal threads** using the **compound rest** on a manual engine lathe. It's designed for machinist students at the technical college level.

## Safety Precautions

- Always **wear safety glasses**.
- Ensure **proper workholding** (3-jaw chuck, collet, or 4-jaw for internal work).
- Remove the **chuck key** before starting the spindle.
- Keep **hands clear** of rotating parts.
- Use **cutting fluid** to extend tool life and improve finish.

---

## Required Tools & Equipment

- Lathe with **threading capability**
- Proper **thread cutting tool** (60° V-profile for most imperial/metric threads)
- **Thread pitch gauge**
- **Threading dial**
- **Micrometer or pitch micrometer**
- **Boring bar** (for internal threads)
- **Center drill and live center** (for external threads)
- **Compound rest** (set to 29° or 27.5°)

## Threading Basics

- **Threads Per Inch (TPI)** or **pitch (mm)** determines the feed rate.
- Use the **quick-change gearbox** to set proper lead screw pitch.
- Cutting at **29° (inch)** or **27.5° (metric)** allows:
  - Shearing only one side of the thread for better finish.
  - Less tool pressure.
- Compound rest is used to **incrementally feed in** the tool at an angle.

---

## Lathe Setup for Threading

1. **Select Thread Pitch**:
   - Use the **gearbox chart** to set correct TPI or pitch.
   - Ensure leadscrew is engaged and feed rod is disengaged.

2. **Install Threading Tool**:
   - Use a tool with a **ground 60° point**.
   - Center it to the workpiece using a center gauge.

3. **Set Compound Angle**:
   - Swivel compound rest to **29°** (inch) or **~27.5°** (metric).
   - This angle should be **toward the operator** (right side of the lathe).

4. **Align Thread Dial**:
   - For inch threads, engage on any line for even TPI (e.g., 16, 20).
   - Use marked positions for odd threads (refer to thread dial chart).
   - Not used for metric threading unless equipped with proper dial.

5. **Zero the Cross Slide & Compound**:
   - Set dials to zero before starting.
   - Use cross slide to retract tool between passes.

## Cutting External Threads

1. **Center drill and face the part**.
2. **Turn to major diameter** (e.g., ½"-13 UNC → 0.500").
3. **Use threading tool centered and set at proper height**.
4. **Make a scratch pass**:
   - Light first cut (~0.002").
   - Check with a thread pitch gauge.

5. **Feed with compound only**:
   - Advance compound 0.002–0.005" per pass.
   - Use cross slide to retract after each pass.
   - Restart at same spot using thread dial.

6. **Repeat passes** until near final depth.
   - Check fit with **thread ring gauge** or mating part.

## Cutting Internal Threads

1. **Drill hole** to correct **tap drill size**:
   - For ½"-13 UNC, use a 27/64" drill.
2. **Bore hole** to near minor diameter if precision is required.
3. **Use a small boring bar** with threading insert or ground HSS tool.
4. **Start with a scratch pass**, verify pitch.
5. **Advance compound** as in external threads.
6. Check thread depth with **go/no-go gauge** or thread plug.

> **Note:** For blind holes, you must stop the spindle and retract quickly at the end.

## Finishing the Thread

- Use a **spring pass** (no compound feed) to clean final thread.
- Deburr the thread edges using a file or deburring tool.
- Test fit with **nut, bolt, or gauge**.
- Apply oil and clean thoroughly.

## Common Tips and Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Double threads | Thread dial engaged at wrong point | Recheck thread dial engagement |
| Poor finish | Dull tool, wrong speed | Sharpen tool, slow down spindle |
| Incorrect pitch | Gearbox misaligned | Double-check feed and pitch settings |
| Tool chatter | Too deep cut or overhang | Take lighter cuts, reduce tool overhang |

## Example Threading Data (External UNC)

| Thread | Major Ø (in) | Tap Drill | TPI | Thread Depth (in) |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| ¼-20   | 0.250        | #7        | 20  | 0.032 |
| ⅜-16   | 0.375        | 5/16"     | 16  | 0.045 |
| ½-13   | 0.500        | 27/64"    | 13  | 0.060 |

## Final Note

Always double-check:
- Thread specs
- Tool clearance
- Thread dial timing
- Safe spindle speed (typically **100–200 RPM**)

**Practice, inspect, and test** your threads. Accurate threads depend on **clean setup**, **precise tool movement**, and **proper engagement**.
